# 🌆 Urban Planning and Design: A Data-Driven Approach
This project explores how data analysis, simulation, and 3D visualization can be combined to improve urban planning. By analyzing key metrics like traffic flow, land use, and population density, the goal is to design smarter, more efficient, and sustainable cities.
------------------------------------------------
### 🔍 Key Highlights
- 📌 Real-time traffic simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)

- 🧭 Strategic land-use analysis for optimized zoning and infrastructure layout

- 🧱 3D modeling to visualize urban development in an immersive way

- 📊 Data analytics to interpret population growth and density trends

- 🗺️ Interactive visual outputs for easier decision-making by planners

- 🔁 Flexible model for application to various city scenarios
------------------------------------------------
### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python – Core language for scripting and data processing

- Pandas / NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

- Matplotlib / Plotly / Seaborn – For creating insightful visualizations

- SUMO – Urban mobility simulation to test and improve traffic systems

- 3D Visualization – (e.g., Blender or Matplotlib 3D) to bring urban designs to life

- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for developing and showcasing analysis
------------------------------------------------
### ⚙️ Workflow Overview
- Data Collection
Gather urban datasets (traffic, land use, population) from open data sources.

- Data Processing & Analysis
Use Python libraries to clean, process, and visualize trends.

- Mobility Simulation
Implement SUMO to simulate traffic conditions and study bottlenecks.

- 3D Urban Visualization
Build a simple 3D model to visually represent the urban design proposal.

- Optimization & Presentation
Analyze outcomes, refine the plan, and present results via visuals and reports.
------------------------------------------------
### 💡 Outcome
A scalable and visually interactive framework that helps urban designers and city planners make smarter, data-informed decisions to build better cities.
